This module is developed as an experimental implementation of the variational interence algorithm derived in Lawrence W. Manning's Princeton University thesis entitled "Mean Field Variational Inference for Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models and Applications in Approximate Q-learning".
