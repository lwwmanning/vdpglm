This module is developed as an experimental implementation of the variational interence algorithm derived in Lawrence W. Manning's Princeton University senior thesis. 

This algorithm uses non-linear optimization to find the tractable distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the true (but presumably intractable) posterior of a Dirichlet Process mixture of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM). 

Currently, we are seeking to implement mixtures of Gaussian distributions for the covariates and mixtures of Bayesian linear regressions for the response variable within an extensible framework.
